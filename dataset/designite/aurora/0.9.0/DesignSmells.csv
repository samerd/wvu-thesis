attic-aurora-rel-0.9.0,org.apache.aurora.scheduler.updater,UpdateFactory,Cyclic Hierarchy,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: UpdateFactoryImpl
attic-aurora-rel-0.9.0,org.apache.aurora.scheduler.updater,Updates,Deficient Encapsulation,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: ACTIVE_JOB_UPDATE_STATES
attic-aurora-rel-0.9.0,org.apache.aurora.scheduler.updater,AddTaskTest,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
attic-aurora-rel-0.9.0,org.apache.aurora.scheduler.updater,JobUpdaterIT,Feature Envy,The tool detected a instance of this smell because releaseAllLocks is more interested in members of the type: LockManager
attic-aurora-rel-0.9.0,org.apache.aurora.scheduler.updater,JobUpdaterIT,Insufficient Modularization,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 37 public methods
attic-aurora-rel-0.9.0,org.apache.aurora.scheduler.updater.strategy,BatchStrategy,Broken Hierarchy,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): ActiveLimitedStrategy
attic-aurora-rel-0.9.0,org.apache.aurora.scheduler.updater.strategy,QueueStrategy,Broken Hierarchy,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): ActiveLimitedStrategy
attic-aurora-rel-0.9.0,org.apache.aurora.scheduler.app.local,FakeMaster,Insufficient Modularization,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 23 public methods
attic-aurora-rel-0.9.0,org.apache.aurora.scheduler.app.local.simulator,Events,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
attic-aurora-rel-0.9.0,org.apache.aurora.scheduler.app.local.simulator,Events,Deficient Encapsulation,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: offer; task
attic-aurora-rel-0.9.0,org.apache.aurora.scheduler.app.local.simulator,Started,Unnecessary Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation, that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields are declared in this class: 
attic-aurora-rel-0.9.0,org.apache.aurora.scheduler.app.local.simulator,OfferAccepted,Deficient Encapsulation,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: offer; task
attic-aurora-rel-0.9.0,org.apache.aurora.scheduler.storage.log.testing,LogOpMatcher,Cyclically-dependent Modularization,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: LogOpMatcher; StreamMatcher
attic-aurora-rel-0.9.0,org.apache.aurora.scheduler.storage.testing,StorageTestUtil,Deficient Encapsulation,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: storeProvider; mutableStoreProvider; taskStore; quotaStore; attributeStore; jobStore; lockStore; schedulerStore; jobUpdateStore; storage
