runners,org.apache.beam.runners.spark.util,SparkSideInputReader,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
runners,org.apache.beam.runners.spark.aggregators.metrics.sink,InMemoryMetricsSinkRule,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
runners,org.apache.beam.runners.spark.aggregators.metrics.sink,SparkMetricsSinkTest,Deficient Encapsulation,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: inMemoryMetricsSink; pipeline; noContextResue; WORDS; EXPECTED_COUNTS
runners,org.apache.beam.runners.spark.translation.streaming.utils,EmbeddedKafkaCluster,Insufficient Modularization,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 21 public methods
