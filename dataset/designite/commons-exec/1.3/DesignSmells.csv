Project Name,Package Name,Type Name,Design Smell,Cause of the Smell
commons-exec-1.3,org.apache.commons.exec,DaemonExecutor,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
commons-exec-1.3,org.apache.commons.exec,ExecuteWatchdog,Deficient Encapsulation,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: INFINITE_TIMEOUT; process; hasWatchdog; watch; caught; killedProcess; watchdog; processStarted
commons-exec-1.3,org.apache.commons.exec,InputStreamPumper,Deficient Encapsulation,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: SLEEPING_TIME; is; os; stop
commons-exec-1.3,org.apache.commons.exec,TimeoutObserver,Cyclically-dependent Modularization,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: TimeoutObserver; Watchdog
commons-exec-1.3,org.apache.commons.exec,CommandLineTest,Insufficient Modularization,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 34 public methods
commons-exec-1.3,org.apache.commons.exec,DefaultExecutorTest,Feature Envy,The tool detected a instance of this smell because testExecuteWithWorkingDirectory is more interested in members of the type: Executor
commons-exec-1.3,org.apache.commons.exec,DefaultExecutorTest,Feature Envy,The tool detected a instance of this smell because testExecuteAsyncWithProcessDestroyer is more interested in members of the type: Executor
commons-exec-1.3,org.apache.commons.exec,DefaultExecutorTest,Insufficient Modularization,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 33 public methods
commons-exec-1.3,org.apache.commons.exec.environment,OpenVmsProcessingEnvironment,Unnecessary Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation, that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields are declared in this class: 
commons-exec-1.3,org.apache.commons.exec.environment,OpenVmsProcessingEnvironment,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
commons-exec-1.3,org.apache.commons.exec.launcher,CommandLauncherImpl,Rebellious Hierarchy,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: exec
commons-exec-1.3,org.apache.commons.exec.launcher,OS2CommandLauncher,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
commons-exec-1.3,org.apache.commons.exec.launcher,WinNTCommandLauncher,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
commons-exec-1.3,org.apache.commons.exec.util,DebugUtils,Deficient Encapsulation,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: COMMONS_EXEC_LENIENT; COMMONS_EXEC_DEBUG
commons-exec-1.3,org.apache.commons.exec.issues,Exec49Test,Feature Envy,The tool detected a instance of this smell because testExec49_1 is more interested in members of the type: Executor
commons-exec-1.3,org.apache.commons.exec.issues,Exec49Test,Feature Envy,The tool detected a instance of this smell because testExec49_2 is more interested in members of the type: Executor
