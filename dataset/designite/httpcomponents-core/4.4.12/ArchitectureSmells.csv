Project Name,Package Name,Architecture Smell,Cause of the Smell
httpcomponents-core-rel-v4.4.12,org.apache.http.examples,Feature Concentration,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [ElementalHttpGet]; [ElementalHttpPost]; [ElementalPoolingHttpGet; WorkerThread]; [ElementalReverseProxy; ProxyHandler; RequestListenerThread; ProxyThread]; [HttpFileServer; StdErrorExceptionLogger; HttpFileHandler]; [PrintVersionInfo]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.5
